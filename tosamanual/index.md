pre-course assessment ensuring that individuals are in the right course,
and to create learning and development roadmaps. Applying Expect
Outcomes to testing enables you to validate if a student has achieved
the learning outcomes from the course.

Expected Outcomes can be set on each of the four or five main skill

## Group actions

<img src="./media/image92.png"
style="width:3.47847in;height:3.57757in" />

In order to activate the **Group Actions** button, you will have to
select a group or sub-group, then you will see a small arrow appearing
in the button.

Group Actions allow you to perform tasks for all the students from a
specific group. The tasks that can be performed include:

- Setting temporary passwords for the entire group

- Registering a group for the same test

- Ability to send registration emails

- Delete pending tests (the credits will be added back to your credit
  bank)

- Setting and defining assessment options for the group

- Setting certification options for the group

- Deleting multiple students

The two main tasks performed at the group level are registering the
group for a test and sending registration emails.

### Registering all candidates in a group to a test

Use the ***Register all candidates in the group to a test*** option to
save time and ensure that all students in the selected group are
assigned to the same test(s).

Access the **Register all candidates in the group to a test** option by
selecting **Candidates** from the main menu, then choose your group and
select **Group actions**.

<img src="./media/image93.png"
style="width:4.18056in;height:3.23417in" />

The **Register Candidates to a Test** window will open. You will then
select the language, the subject, the test, and the session. Then click
on **Register** or **Register and close.**

Click on **Register to a test** and choose the following:

1)  **Language** of the test

2)  **Subject** (Excel, Word, Google Docs…)

3)  **Test** version and type (assessment, certification…)

4)  **Session** (if applicable): A test session is a specific date and
    time range when your students will be able to log into the platform
    to take their test.

5)  **Requires Full Screen**: Use this option if you want to make sure
    your student remains in full screen mode until completion of their
    assessment(s).

<img src="./media/image94.png"
style="width:6.3in;height:5.90972in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" />

You will also be able to search for a test using keywords by using the
**Search by input** field.

Click **Register** if you are registering a student for multiple tests,
then continue to register for any additional tests. Click **Register and
close** if you want to assign a single test to a student.

### Sending an invitation email to a group

<img src="./media/image93.png"
style="width:4.62014in;height:3.57361in" />

Once you have assigned a test to a group, it’s time to send an invitation email. Assuming all members of the group will be taking the same test(s), you can use **Send registration emails to all candidates in the group**.

<img src="./media/image96.png"
style="width:5.4875in;height:2.91944in" />


The **Message Details** window opens. Edit your email subject, choose your email template, sender email address (if you have entered one). You can send a copy of the email to another administrator or to yourself. When you are ready, click **Send**.

Once you click send, the invitation email will be sent to each student,
providing them the link, their credentials and the test(s) that you have
assigned them.

If you do not want to send your invitation email to your group right
away, you can have the system send it at a later date by selecting
**Schedule sending**.

### Other group actions

**Group actions** also allow you to:

**(1) Set a temporary password for all candidates in the group.** This
will allow you to set a unique password that all students can use to log
into the platform. Once logged into their account for the first time,
the students will have to create their own password.

**(2) Delete non started tests.** If you delete the groups’ pending
tests, all credits will be returned to your credit bank.

**(3) Set assessment/certification options for group candidates.**
Allows you to customize the assessment/certification options for a
defined group.

**(4) Delete Selected candidates.** Choose this option if you want to delete the groups’ selected students.
